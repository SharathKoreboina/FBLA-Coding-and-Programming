# Coding and Programming

Overview: 

A Java database program made for the 2023-24 FBLA Coding and Programming Competition. This Program allows our school's Career and Technical Education Department to collect and store information about businesses and community partners. We used Java and SQL primarily because they supported our logic and filtration system and were adaptable. We also used JDBC(Java Database Connectivity) to connect to the users' database/server. This program is not meant to be publicly released to schools. Our only main challenge was that our SQL was running on our servers and this could be a problem since the users won't have access to these. 

How to Install and Run the Project:

(MAKE SURE TO DO THE FOLLOWING FIRST)

To start, you will need to download an IDE for JAVA (Eclipse or IntelliJ) and an IDE for SQL (MySQL workbench). You will also need to use Git for source control to clone our Github repository into a code editor of your choice (We recommend the IDEs listed before). You can also download it as a ZIP and extract it. 

External Dependencies required:

Link to to SQL IDE: https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/

Link to JDBC connector: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j
Copy and paste this link into a web browser and select "platform independent" from the drop-down menu.
Download the zip archive.

Running the Project: 

Once you finished cloning the repository on your preferred JAVA and SQL IDE, run the MySQLDatabaseTester java class. This class will start by asking for the URL for your MySQL database server along with your username and password. Press enter after each prompt. Once connected, the program gives the user 3 options, add entries, filter data, or view all data. The program will run until the user indicates that they are done by typing done and pressing enter.
